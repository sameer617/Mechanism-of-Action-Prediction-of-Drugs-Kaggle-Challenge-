# Mechanism-of-Action-Prediction-of-Drugs-Kaggle-Challenge-
Researchers are as yet ignorant regarding how a drug interfaces with the objective locales of the cells of our body(the biochemical response) to curb the protein related to the infection. This information is fundamental, the obliviousness of which may prompt possible risks as moment synthetic changes in the drug may end up being disastrous for the body. AI and Deep Learning act as the hero to dispose of this issue as they attempt to set up a connection between gene expression levels and cell viability of cell lines with MoAs. The Dataset given contains data of reactions of various cell lines to the drugs and those reactions will be utilized to predict the occurrence of the MoAs.
